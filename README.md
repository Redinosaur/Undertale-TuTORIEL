# Undertale-TuTORIEL
This is a coding assignment for our Computer Science 3 Honors class.  We are going to create 4 separate Undertale fight scenes in Java, the first of the 4 being a tutorial fight with Flowey.  This can help new users get acquainted with the game better and work their way up to harder bosses.
The other 3 bosses that will be a part of this assignment are:
- Asgore (created by Redinosaur)
- Asriel (created by esfoth)
- Sans (created by Puppyvolcano)

UPDATE: Updates will be posted here when a major change or addition to the game has been added.
